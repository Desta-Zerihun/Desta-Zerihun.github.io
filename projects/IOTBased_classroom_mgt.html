                    Internet of Things(IoT) with the concept of integrating connectivity, sensors, data analysis and decision making in an underlying framework has ease many real world problems. Classrooms are learning spaces which are found in educational institutions of all kinds, from preschools to universities. In educational institutions much of the time is wasted while entering the classroom in queue, picking up their own materials, 
                    sit up and down while answering to questions and it makes very much difficult for teachers to handle huge number of students without any technology. On an average, a student spends about 1025 hours each year just for following instructions given to him/her. Connected devices and emerging trending technologies will help teachers to focus on student's learning needs rather than wasting time for managing large
                     group procedures because of which they cannot give enough time for developing some extra qualities in students. Connected devices would definitely help teachers to transform classroom experience. This paper consists of some practical scenarios of about how I.O.T can be implemented for a better classroom experience and how teachers can focus on student's skills and which will help to save the time of both.
                   The attendance system that we currently use now is recorded by signing our signature on a piece of paper, which makes tracking and processing troublesome. It will need to be digitalized by using various sensors and module on it. Besides, the current conventional classroom system does not implement any energy saving system, which contributed to the high cost in paying electrical bills. Thus, in this paper, an IoT based Smart Classroom System is presented. 
                   This system consists of two features; the autonomous attendance system as well as an energy saving technology implementation. As for the autonomous attendance system, the attendances that were taken from student card will be digitalized and send to the server to be processed, and then the attendance records are able to be viewed via web or Virtuino app. Meanwhile, through the energy saving technology, students or lecturer does not purposely need to switch off the air conditioning, 
                   fans and lights each time they leave the class anymore. Overall, the whole system will increase efficiency in terms of attendance recording and processing and save huge amount of cost spend in electricity bill.
                   You can monitor all the data from your smart phone by using Virtuino app. Then a twit can be send to students parents mobile automatically if the student is absent from class. With the incorporation of IoT devices and computational algorithms such as machine learning and data analysis, it can ease the monitoring task and increase efficiency in terms of attendance recording and processing and save huge amount of cost spend in electricity bill.
